# METCS521

All code posted here is an course related academic exercise.
This is an academic hash cracking exerise based on exisitng attack algorithms so I am going to simulate password attacks.  This is not intended for any use.

Again this code is not fit for any use.  These tasks have all been accomplished by more experience developers.  Please feel free to ask me questions, but understand that this code might never see a production ready level of functionality.
